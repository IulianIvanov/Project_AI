1.Python project (AI)
This classifier is trained to predict the native language of a document based on its English translation.
The training data consists of a collection of 2983 documents (training examples) in a human readable format (.txt files).
These .txt files contain the English translation of the original content in a native-language.
Each training example is labelled with a number between 0 and 10, giving the native - language origin of its content.
The goal is to predict the label for the 1497 test documents.
